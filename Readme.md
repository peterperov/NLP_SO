# NLP_SO 

NLP_SO is a beginner's effort to get comments, posts and answers from StackOverflow and run some Natural Language Processing on them. 

It is in Work In Progress stage, so don't expect to find a lot of working code in it. I try to push only when "it works on my machine", but don't expect miracles. When the project gets to somewhat finished stage I'll clear up the code, but no promises. 

Hopefully it will make it easier to someone who like me is starting with the tech. 

## What you find here: 

SoApp - Visual Studio Community 2019 solution with mostly working code.
Util - mostly messing around with Python codes before they go to SoApp.
Util\WIP - WorkInProgress what it says on the tin.
